# 2025-06-22 Markpub Pytest

- PyTest code and `tests` directory and contents updated from "Massive Wiki Builder" instance to "Markpub"  
- One re-learning was that the `_footer.html` element used for the PyTest removes the HTML line that shows the date and time of the most recent build. This allows the `test-output` and `baseline` directory comparison to succeed.
	- TODO: put this information into the `tests` `README` file.
