# MarkPub - Static Site Generator using Markdown

The markpub PyPI package builds a nice static website from a directory of Markdown files. The website supports wiki-links, transclusion, and provides full-text search.

Use cases include publishing Obsidian vaults and operating [Massive Wiki](https://massivewiki.org/) sites. But you don't need anything more than a directory of Markdown files you edit with a text editor.

For more information, see <https://pypi.org/project/markpub/>.
