# MarkPub

## A Static Site Generator using Markdown

The **MarkPub PyPI package** builds a static website from a directory of Markdown files. The website supports wiki-links, transclusion, and provides full-text search. MarkPub is a [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator).

Use cases include publishing Obsidian vaults and operating [Massive Wiki](https://massive,wiki) sites. But you don't need anything more than a directory of Markdown files you edit with a text editor to make a nice website.
