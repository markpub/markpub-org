# MarkPub - Markdown static site builder

## Hello, world.

_we're bootstrapping markpub and this site, stand by._

The markpub PyPI package builds a static website from a directory of Markdown files. The website supports wiki-links, transclusion, and provides full-text search.

For more information, see <https://pypi.org/project/markpub/>.
